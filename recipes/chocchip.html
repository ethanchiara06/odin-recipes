    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <uL>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Vanilla Abstract</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Chocolate Chips</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </uL>

    <h3>Steps On How to Make Them</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>The first step in making these easy chocolate chip cookies to to combine the dry ingredients in a medium size bowl.</li>
        <li>Next, cream together butter and sugars, make sure to soften the butter early by taking it out of the fridge at least two hours before baking so it’s ready to go when you need it. You can also warm it in the microwave for about 7 seconds, but be very careful not to melt it.</li>
        <li>Once butter/sugar mixture is beaten well, add the eggs & vanilla and beat to combine.</li>
        <li>Add dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Then add the chocolate chips and beat until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Once the cookie dough is finished, it’s time to portion and roll the dough. I know many people eyeball it when making cookies, however I highly recommend using a cookie scoop.</li>
        <li>Using a cooking scoop ensures that all the cookies are uniform in size so that they bake evenly. I love this stainless steel cookie scoop and use it every time I make cookies. </li>
        <li>If you are baking the cookies immediately simply roll them into balls, place them evenly apart on a baking sheet (about 1.5 to 2 inches apart) and bake at 375 degrees for 8-10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
