    <h3>Steps to Make the Delicious Bowl</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil.
                Add the rice and a pinch of salt. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for the recommended time (about 15-20 minutes for white rice, or as per package instructions for brown rice).
                Once cooked, fluff the rice with a fork and stir in chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice if desired.</li>
            <li>Preheat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat.
                Rub the chicken breasts with chipotle seasoning, salt, pepper, and olive oil.
                Grill or cook the chicken for about 6-7 minutes on each side or until fully cooked (internal temperature of 165°F or 74°C). Let it rest for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
            <li>In each serving bowl, start with a generous scoop of cilantro-lime rice as the base.</li>   
            <li>Arrange sliced grilled chicken, black beans, corn, diced tomatoes, and red onion around the bowl in sections.</li>
            <li>Top with shredded lettuce for a refreshing crunch.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle shredded Monterey Jack cheese over the bowl.
                Add a dollop of guacamole for a creamy richness.</li>
            <li>Drizzle salsa over the top to infuse the bowl with a burst of flavor.</li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients together, squeezing lime juice over the bowl if desired, and relish the explosion of flavors in each bite.
            </li>
        </ol>
